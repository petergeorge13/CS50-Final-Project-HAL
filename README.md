# CS50-Final-Project-HAL
Hello world, this is my CS50 final project. When deciding what to do for my project I knew that I wanted to do something sports related that I would use. I realized that I frequently missed Harvard Athletics events I would have been interested in because I did not know about them/did not have them in my calendar. That inspired me to create this program which automatically adds whatever harvard athletics events you want to you google calendar based on sport. 

This is a command-line program so it is going to require the user to download Python but never fear I have added step-by step instructions below in order to make the process as painless as possible.
